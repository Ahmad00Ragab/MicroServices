what is Microservices Architechture?
Microservices Architechture is a way of designing the software system as a collection of small services that  
integerate and communicate with each other through a network (often REST APIs) and each small service is responsible
for a buisiness capability and can be developed, deployed and scaled independently.


what is the main reason that made us to use the Microservices Architechture?
Diverse Technology Stacks : when we want to use different Technology stacks for different parts of our system,
each Microservice has its own Technology stack.


what is a service?
a self-contained unit of functionality that perform a specific task.


what is the meaning of Technology Agnostic?
when we say the Microservice is Technology Agnostic, we could have a Microservice that is built using java 
and another Microservice is built using python and those two Microservices integerate with each others.

what is the monolothic system?
a way of desiging the system as a single unified unit.


what are the characterstics of Microservices?
1. independent services : each service works independently (developed, deployed, and scaled)
2. communicattion between services over a network : often through RESTFul APIs (synchronous communication) 
or message queue (asynchronous communication)
3. service discovery : services need to know how to reach each other.(done through service registery)
4. API Gateway: ceneralized points that handles the requests coming from the clients to the microservices 
5. database per service : each service has its own database
